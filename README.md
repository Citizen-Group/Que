# QUE
QUE is a proposal to produce automation for ESO to address these time concerns. We will provide an attendance tracking system, with custom physical devices and displays. We will produce a solution that caters to the unique needs of the homeless, impoverished and thoes with physical and psychological difficulties.

## Background
Employment Services Ottawa - more specifically their department handling Ontario Works on behalf on the Ontario Government, suffers from a host of small problems. These problems erodes efficiency and greatly limits time available to their skilled (and expensive) employees to focus on the clients. ESO would like to be proposed a solution to this problem.  

## Approach
To address the current problem of filling form data manually every time someone shows up. We propose that If can establish a way to ID the person, we could then develop a system automate the filling of forms, among other things. We suggest using the proven low-cost technology of scanning a finger or tap a card. Low grade optical face tracking is also a modern option.

This then will trigger custom software that will automate the manual paperwork, filling out the information needed on the existing system. This on aggerate will save a lot of time, money and allow more focus on the clients. All this will subsequently improve the performance of the services and the tediousness on the staff. 

Secondary, because now there is a layer of automation. They will be able to achieve their data collection goals. This will allow them to consider new styles of programs, produce novel ways to provide out reach, display their services and digitalize the core of social services.  

We believe the combination of all of this will have marked positive impacts on service quality, and allow ESO to reach the short-term goals they requested of us.

QUE is developed with love in Bayshore.
